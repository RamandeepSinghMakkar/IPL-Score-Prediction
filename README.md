# IPL-Score-Prediction
In this project, different Machine Learning models have been used to predict IPL score. 

Algorithms Used

1) Decision Tree Regressor
2) Linear Regression
3) Random Forest Regression
4) Lasso Regression
5) Support Vector Machine Regression
6) Neural Network Regression

Batting team, bowling team, overs, wickets fell, etc have to be input to get the final predicted score at any time of the game.
